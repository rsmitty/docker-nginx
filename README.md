## Lab 03

Desired outline:

- Highlight each of the new practices we're showing:
 - Chaining together all RUNS where possible
 - EXPOSE for multiple ports at once
 - redirecting logs to stdout/stderr for `docker log` to function
- Boot this image and show that it still works for index.html
- Show `docker log` working
- View less layers somehow
